Quick script to see how Qt5 works on Python, and to learn how to create AppImage for python modules.

This is a D personality test ripped from [here](https://www.health.harvard.edu/newsletter_article/Type_D_for_distressed), enjoy.... 

(If you are interested in the test I guess you can just do it in the link above)


```
chmod +x dpersona.AppImage
./dpersona.AppImage
```
