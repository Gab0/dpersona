I make contact easily when I meet people
I often make a fuss about unimportant things
I often talk to strangers
I often feel unhappy
I am often irritated
I often feel inhibited in social interactions
I take a gloomy view of things
I find it hard to start a conversation
I am often in a bad mood
I am a closed kind of person
I would rather keep people at a distance
I often find myself worrying about something
I am often down in the dumps
When socializing, I don't find the right things to talk about
